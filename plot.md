The player should feel: "This is normal… but something feels off. Maybe it's just the winter." Here is your new strong, subtle, grounded beginning, perfect for a slow-burn horror.

❄️ NEW GAME → OPENING SCENE IN THE CHURCH

A realistic beginning with no confirmed anomalies.

BLACK SCREEN

The sound of someone sweeping snow off stone steps. Wind whistles through a cracked windowframe.

Fade in slowly.

⛪ SCENE 1: CHURCH INTERIOR — MORNING

[BACKGROUND: Small Catholic church interior, Wrocław Diocese. Morning light filters weakly through frosted stained glass windows, casting dim blue and red patterns on the stone floor. Wooden pews line both sides, their dark wood showing a thin layer of frost. Votive candles flicker unevenly in their red glass holders near the altar. The air is visibly cold—breath would fog. A faint layer of ice has formed on the metal candle holders. The heating system has clearly failed; you can see your breath. The church bell tolls distantly, muffled by heavy snowfall outside. Everything feels still, quiet, reverent but uncomfortably cold.]

[CHARACTER: Agnieszka - A woman in her early thirties, wearing a simple dark habit. She has kind but observant brown eyes, dark hair neatly tucked under her veil. Her hands are clasped in prayer, showing reddened fingers from the cold. She has a calm, measured presence—someone who thinks before she speaks. Her posture is straight but not rigid, showing both discipline and humanity.]

Agnieszka kneels at a pew near the front, her breath visible in the cold air. She finishes her prayer, making the sign of the cross with deliberate, practiced movements.

Agnieszka (inner thought): "Another cold morning. The heater's been out for weeks now. But at least the church is still standing. Still here for those who need it."

She rises slowly, her knees stiff from the cold wooden pew. She pulls her habit tighter around herself, then walks toward the vestry door.

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 1

Choice A: [Look around the church one more time]
→ Agnieszka pauses, taking in the empty pews, the flickering candles, the frost on the windows. She notices something—one of the candles has gone out. She relights it before continuing.

Choice B: [Go directly to the vestry]
→ Agnieszka moves purposefully toward the door, not lingering. She has business to attend to.

[SCENE TRANSITION: Door opens, revealing the vestry]

⛪ SCENE 2: VESTRY — CONTINUED

[BACKGROUND: A small, cluttered room behind the altar. The vestry is cramped but organized. A wooden table against one wall is covered with papers, a parish registry open to a recent page. A small radio sits on the table, its display showing weather alerts. A thermos sits nearby, steam rising from it. A phone on the wall keeps ringing intermittently but goes unanswered. The room is slightly warmer than the church but still cold—the heater in the corner is clearly broken, its vents silent. A folder with the diocesan seal sits prominently on the table. The walls are lined with shelves holding vestments, books, and church supplies. A small window shows the snow falling outside.]

[CHARACTER: Father Stanisław - A man in his late fifties, wearing a black cassock. He has graying hair, tired eyes with dark circles beneath them, and lines of worry etched on his face. His shoulders are slightly slumped from exhaustion. He stands near the table, one hand resting on it for support. When he sees Agnieszka, his expression softens into a warm but weary smile. His movements are deliberate but slow, as if every action requires effort.]

Father Stanisław stands by the table, looking at the folder. He turns when Agnieszka enters, his face lighting up with relief.

Father Stanisław: "Sister Agnieszka… thank you for coming early. I know it's not easy getting here in this weather."

[CHARACTER: Agnieszka - Now standing in the vestry doorway. Her cheeks are flushed from the cold walk. She removes her gloves, revealing red, chapped hands. She rubs them together, trying to restore feeling. Her expression is attentive, ready to listen.]

Agnieszka stands before him, removing her gloves and rubbing her hands together. Her fingers are red from the cold.

Agnieszka: "The walk was fine, Father. A bit cold, but nothing I'm not used to."

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 2

Choice A: [Mention the cold church]
→ Agnieszka: "The church is freezing, Father. The parishioners will struggle if this continues much longer."

Choice B: [Ask if everything is all right]
→ Agnieszka: "You look tired, Father. Is everything all right?"

Choice C: [Wait for him to continue]
→ Agnieszka simply nods, waiting for him to explain why he called her here early.

[If Choice A selected:]
Father Stanisław: "I know. I've called the heating company three times this week. They say they're overwhelmed. Everyone's heating is failing in this cold."

[If Choice B selected:]
Father Stanisław: "Tired? Yes, I suppose I am. But that's not why I asked you here."

[If Choice C selected:]
Father Stanisław continues without pause.

Father Stanisław: "How long have you been with us now? Three years?"

Agnieszka: "Almost four, Father. Since I transferred from Kraków."

Father Stanisław's expression becomes thoughtful, almost nostalgic.

Father Stanisław: "Four years. And in that time, you've been invaluable. The parishioners trust you. They come to you with problems they wouldn't bring to me."

Agnieszka shifts slightly, a modest gesture.

Agnieszka: "I just listen, Father. That's all most people need—someone to hear them."

Father Stanisław: "It's more than that, and you know it. You have a gift for seeing through... complications. For finding the truth in difficult situations."

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 3

Choice A: [Accept the compliment gracefully]
→ Agnieszka: "Thank you, Father. I try my best."

Choice B: [Deflect with humility]
→ Agnieszka: "I'm just doing my duty, Father. Nothing more."

Choice C: [Ask what this is about]
→ Agnieszka: "Father, you're being unusually complimentary. What's this really about?"

[If Choice C selected:]
Father Stanisław gives a small, tired laugh.

Father Stanisław: "You see? That's exactly what I mean. You don't let people dance around things."

He moves to the table, picking up the folder. His movements are slow, deliberate.

Father Stanisław: "I'm afraid the diocese has a request. An unusual one."

He rubs his temples with his free hand, a gesture of exhaustion.

Father Stanisław: "You know how the winter has been. Entire districts cut off. People frightened. Rumors spreading like wildfire."

He hesitates, looking at the folder but not opening it yet. His expression is conflicted.

Father Stanisław: "One rumor in particular reached His Excellency. It's been growing for weeks now. Getting louder. More insistent."

Agnieszka stands attentively, her posture calm but alert. She watches his face carefully.

Agnieszka: "What kind of rumor?"

Father Stanisław: "A… man. In Zatonie. A small town, about two hours from here. People are calling him a saint."

Agnieszka's expression doesn't change, but there's a subtle shift in her posture—slight tension, increased attention.

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 4

Choice A: [Show skepticism]
→ Agnieszka raises an eyebrow. "Another faith healer? Or one of those charismatic types who gather crowds?"

Choice B: [Show curiosity]
→ Agnieszka: "A saint? What makes them say that?"

Choice C: [Remain neutral]
→ Agnieszka: "I see. And what does the diocese want us to do about it?"

[If Choice A selected:]
Father Stanisław: "We hope so. That would make this much easier. A simple fraud, we can handle. But if people truly believe..."

[If Choice B selected:]
Father Stanisław: "That's what we need to find out. The testimonies are... compelling. But also concerning."

[If Choice C selected:]
Father Stanisław: "That's what I'm getting to. But first, you should see what we're dealing with."

He finally opens the folder, holding it out to her. Inside: written testimonies from locals. The handwriting is sloppy, ink smudged by cold, written on various scraps of paper.

Father Stanisław: "Read them. All of them. Then tell me what you think."

Agnieszka takes the folder, her movements careful, deliberate. She reads the first testimony aloud, her voice steady but with a hint of something—uncertainty? Concern?

Agnieszka: "'He healed my son's cough. The boy had been sick for weeks, coughing so hard he couldn't sleep. After the man touched his forehead, he was better by morning. The cough was gone. Just... gone.'"

She looks up at Father Stanisław, her expression analytical.

Agnieszka: "This could be coincidence. Or the boy was already recovering. Children get better. It's what they do."

Father Stanisław: "Read the others. Then we'll discuss."

Agnieszka continues reading, her voice becoming slightly more uncertain with each one:

Agnieszka: "'The snow melts around him. I saw it with my own eyes. He walked through the square, and the ice beneath his feet turned to water. Not slush. Water. Like it was spring.'"

Agnieszka: "'He spoke and I felt warm again. My arthritis, the pain I've had for ten years… it's gone. I can move my hands. I can walk without the cane. He touched my shoulder, and the warmth spread through my whole body.'"

Agnieszka: "'He is chosen. God has sent him to us. I know it in my heart. He is a saint, and we are blessed to witness it.'"

She closes the folder, handing it back. Her expression is thoughtful, conflicted.

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 5

Choice A: [Express skepticism]
→ Agnieszka: "People are desperate, Father. When the cold is this cruel, when hope is scarce… they'll believe anything. These could all be exaggerations, wishful thinking."

Choice B: [Show concern]
→ Agnieszka: "These are serious claims. If they're false, we need to stop this before it gets out of control. If they're true..."

Choice C: [Ask about verification]
→ Agnieszka: "Has anyone from the diocese actually seen these things? Verified any of these claims?"

[If Choice A selected:]
Father Stanisław: "I know. I've told myself the same thing. But there are too many of them. Too many people saying the same things. And they're not all desperate. Some are educated, rational people."

[If Choice B selected:]
Father Stanisław: "Exactly. That's why we need to act. But carefully. Very carefully."

[If Choice C selected:]
Father Stanisław: "No. That's the problem. We've only received reports. Secondhand accounts. We need someone there. Someone who can see clearly."

Father Stanisław sighs, his shoulders slumping slightly. The weight of responsibility is visible in his posture.

Father Stanisław: "We can't afford another media scandal. If people keep calling him a saint… without the Church verifying anything… it could spiral out of control. Or worse, if it's a fraud, people could get hurt."

He trails off, but Agnieszka understands. The Church has been through enough controversies. They need to control the narrative, but they also need the truth.

Father Stanisław: "The diocese wants you to investigate. Quietly. Discreetly. Just speak with him. Observe. And report truthfully."

Agnieszka: "Why me?"

Father Stanisław: "Because you're balanced. Rational. Compassionate. You won't jump to conclusions, but you also won't dismiss what you see. And you have a way with people—they trust you."

A pause. Agnieszka considers this, her expression thoughtful.

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 6

Choice A: [Accept the assignment]
→ Agnieszka: "I'll do it. When do we leave?"

Choice B: [Ask for more information]
→ Agnieszka: "Before I agree, I need to know more. What exactly are we looking for? What are the parameters?"

Choice C: [Express hesitation]
→ Agnieszka: "Father, I'm not sure I'm the right person for this. What if I miss something? What if I'm wrong?"

[If Choice A selected:]
Father Stanisław: "Thank you, Agnieszka. I knew I could count on you."

[If Choice B selected:]
Father Stanisław: "Fair question. You're looking for the truth. That's all. Observe. Listen. Document. Report back what you see. No assumptions. No conclusions until you have facts."

[If Choice C selected:]
Father Stanisław: "That's exactly why you're the right person. You question yourself. You're careful. That's what we need."

Father Stanisław: "You leave at noon. Brother Marek will accompany you — freshly ordained, enthusiastic, perhaps too enthusiastic."

Agnieszka: "I don't know Brother Marek."

Father Stanisław: "He's new. Transferred here last month. Young, idealistic. Thinks every problem has a simple solution."

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 7

Choice A: [Ask about Marek's experience]
→ Agnieszka: "How much field experience does he have? Is he ready for something like this?"

Choice B: [Express concern about working with someone new]
→ Agnieszka: "Working with someone I don't know could be... challenging. Especially if he's as enthusiastic as you say."

Choice C: [Accept the arrangement]
→ Agnieszka: "I'll work with him. We'll manage."

[If Choice A selected:]
Father Stanisław: "This will be his first real assignment. But he's smart, and he's eager to learn. That's why you're going—to guide him."

[If Choice B selected:]
Father Stanisław: "I know. But he needs the experience, and you need someone with you. Safety in numbers, especially going to an unknown situation."

[If Choice C selected:]
Father Stanisław: "Good. I trust you'll keep him grounded."

Agnieszka: "And you want me to keep him grounded?"

Father Stanisław gives a weak smile, the first real expression of humor since the conversation began.

Father Stanisław: "The Lord knows someone has to. He means well, but… well, you'll see. Just try to keep his enthusiasm from getting the better of him."

🎮 FIRST MAJOR PLAYER CHOICE

Choice A: "Is the man dangerous?"
→ Father Stanisław's expression becomes serious. "We don't think so. But we don't know. That's why we're sending you—to find out. If you feel threatened at any point, you leave immediately. Your safety comes first. Always."

Choice B: "Why me specifically?"
→ Father Stanisław: "Because you see things clearly. You don't let emotion cloud your judgment, but you also don't dismiss what you can't explain. That's exactly what we need right now. Someone who can find the truth, whatever it is."

Choice C: "I'll go. People need answers."
→ Father Stanisław: "Thank you, Agnieszka. I knew I could count on you. Just remember—observe, don't interfere. We need facts, not assumptions. And be careful. Both of you."

No supernatural hints. All grounded.

🎒 SCENE 3: AGNIESZKA'S ROOM — PREPARATION

[BACKGROUND: A small, practical room in the church's residential wing. The room is sparsely furnished but personal. A single bed with a simple wooden frame, made neatly with a dark blanket. A small wooden desk against one wall, its surface clean but showing signs of use. A bookshelf holds religious texts, a few novels, and a small collection of personal items. A crucifix hangs on the wall above the bed. A photograph sits on the desk—a family photo showing Agnieszka (younger, in civilian clothes) with her parents and younger sister, all smiling. The window shows the snow falling outside. The room is cold but bearable. A small bag sits open on the bed, ready for packing.]

[CHARACTER: Agnieszka - Now in her room, she's removed her outer habit, showing a simpler indoor habit. Her movements are methodical, practiced. She packs with efficiency, each item considered before being placed. Her expression is thoughtful, slightly distant, as if her mind is already on the journey ahead.]

Agnieszka stands in her room, packing methodically. She moves with purpose, each action deliberate.

Items she packs (shown as she places them in her bag):
- Travel documents
- A notebook and pen
- Her rosary
- A small Bible, well-worn, its cover showing years of use
- Extra gloves and a scarf
- A thermos for tea

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 8

Choice A: [Look at the family photograph]
→ Agnieszka pauses at the photograph on her desk. Her sister, Kasia, smiles back at her. Agnieszka touches the frame gently.

Agnieszka (inner thought): "Four years. Has it really been that long since I've seen them? I should write. When I get back."

Choice B: [Check the parish records]
→ Agnieszka picks up the parish records from her desk. She looks up Zatonie—it's a small industrial town, population declining. Factories closed years ago. Most young people left. Only the elderly and a few families remain.

Agnieszka (inner thought): "A dying town. Desperate people. Of course they'd latch onto hope, even if it's false."

Choice C: [Pack quickly and leave]
→ Agnieszka finishes packing efficiently, not lingering on personal items. She's focused on the task ahead.

[If Choice A selected, she continues packing after the moment. If Choice B selected, she closes the records and finishes packing.]

She closes her bag, checking that everything is in place. Her expression is determined but calm.

✝️ SCENE 4: CHURCH EXTERIOR — LEAVING

[BACKGROUND: The exterior of the small city church. Snow falls heavily, creating a curtain of white. The church's stone facade is old, weathered, but well-maintained. Stone steps lead down to the street, where people move through the snow. The street is busy despite the weather—mothers with children, elderly parishioners, delivery trucks struggling through the slush. The bus stop is visible nearby, its glass fogged. Everything is muted by the snow, sounds dampened, colors washed out to grays and whites.]

[CHARACTER: Agnieszka - Now wearing her coat over her habit, scarf wrapped around her neck, gloves on. She stands at the top of the church steps, looking out at the winter scene. Her expression is observant, taking in everything around her.]

As Agnieszka steps outside the church, snowfall swirls around her. She pulls her coat tighter, adjusting her scarf.

Two elderly parishioners—Pani Maria and Pani Helena—approach, walking slowly through the snow.

[CHARACTER: Pani Maria - An elderly woman in her seventies, wrapped in multiple layers of coats and scarves. Her face is weathered, her hands gnarled with age. She moves slowly, carefully, each step deliberate on the icy ground. Her expression is hopeful but worried.]

[CHARACTER: Pani Helena - Also elderly, but sharper, more skeptical. She walks with a slight limp, using a cane. Her expression is stern, her eyes watchful. She's the kind of person who's seen too much to believe easily.]

Pani Maria mutters to herself as they pass:

Pani Maria: "They say that man in Zatonie keeps people warm. That he's blessed. That God sent him."

Pani Helena corrects her, voice sharp but not unkind:

Pani Helena: "Or he's a fraud. There's always someone claiming miracles in winters like this. Remember that woman in '89? Claimed she could heal with her touch? Turned out she was just good at making people feel better with words."

Pani Maria: "But what if this one is different? What if God really did send someone to help us?"

Pani Helena: "Then the Church would know. They'd announce it. They wouldn't let rumors spread like this."

They notice Agnieszka and fall silent, offering respectful nods before continuing on their way.

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 9

Choice A: [Stop and talk to them]
→ Agnieszka: "Pani Maria, Pani Helena. Good morning. I couldn't help but overhear. What have you heard about this man in Zatonie?"

Pani Maria: "Oh, Sister! Just rumors, you know. But my neighbor's cousin went there. Said it was like... like being near a fire, but without the fire. Does that make sense?"

Pani Helena: "It makes sense that people are desperate. That's all."

Choice B: [Nod and continue walking]
→ Agnieszka offers a polite nod and continues on her way, but she's listening to their conversation as they walk away.

Choice C: [Ask Pani Helena for her opinion]
→ Agnieszka: "Pani Helena, you seem skeptical. Why?"

Pani Helena: "Because I've lived long enough to see patterns, Sister. Desperate times, desperate people, false hope. It's always the same."

Agnieszka watches them go, then looks up at the falling snow. The flakes are large, heavy. More is coming.

Agnieszka (inner thought): "People are desperate. They'll believe anything when the cold is this cruel. But what if… what if there's something to it? What if this man really is helping people?"

She shakes her head, dismissing the thought.

Agnieszka (inner thought): "No. I need to stay grounded. Observe. Don't assume. That's my job."

❄️ Fade to black.

Text fades in: "DAY 1 — INVESTIGATION"

❄️ SCENE 5: OUTSIDE THE CHURCH — BUS STOP

[BACKGROUND: A city bus stop, covered but still cold. The glass walls are fogged, showing the breath of people waiting inside. Snow falls heavily, blurring the view of the street. Cars pass slowly, their headlights cutting through the white. The bus stop timetable is partially obscured by ice. People huddle inside, trying to stay warm. The scene is gray, muted, cold.]

[CHARACTER: Agnieszka - Standing at the bus stop, her breath visible. She's waiting, but also observing. Her expression is calm but alert, taking in everything around her.]

The heavy wooden door of the church closes behind her with a muted thud. Snowfall has intensified; it blurs the street like static.

Agnieszka pulls her scarf up and walks down the steps toward the bus stop. People move briskly through the cold:
- a mother pulling a child on a sled
- elderly parishioners shuffling cautiously
- a delivery truck stuck in slush, engine sputtering
- a city worker scraping ice off a bus stop timetable

Everything is normal, recognizable winter struggle, no strangeness.

Agnieszka stops at the bus stop, breath thick in the air. A young woman standing nearby, wrapped in too many coats, keeps looking at Agnieszka's cross pendant.

[CHARACTER: Magda - A young woman in her late twenties, early thirties. She's bundled in multiple layers, but still shivering. Her face is pale, worried. Her eyes are red-rimmed, as if she's been crying or not sleeping. She wrings her hands nervously, her thin gloves doing little to protect her from the cold. She looks like someone carrying a heavy burden.]

Magda: "Excuse me… you work at the church, right? I've seen you there."

Agnieszka turns to face her, her expression open and kind.

Agnieszka: "Yes. I'm Sister Agnieszka. How can I help you?"

Magda hesitates, wringing her hands. Her gloves are thin, her fingers red.

Magda: "I'm Magda. Magda Nowak. I… I wanted to ask you something. If you have a moment?"

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 10

Choice A: [Offer to help]
→ Agnieszka: "Of course. What is it? You look worried."

Choice B: [Be cautious but kind]
→ Agnieszka: "I have a moment. What's on your mind?"

Choice C: [Notice she's distressed]
→ Agnieszka: "You seem upset. Is everything all right? How can I help?"

[All choices lead to Magda opening up, but the tone varies slightly.]

Magda: "Do you… do you know about the man in Zatonie? They say he's performing blessings. That he can heal people."

Agnieszka keeps her expression neutral, but she's listening carefully. This is relevant to her mission.

Agnieszka: "I've heard rumors. We're looking into it, actually."

Magda's eyes light up with desperate hope.

Magda: "You are? So it might be real?"

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 11

Choice A: [Be honest but gentle]
→ Agnieszka: "We don't know yet. That's why we're investigating. We need to verify these claims before we can say anything."

Choice B: [Show compassion]
→ Agnieszka: "I understand you're hoping it's real. Can you tell me why this matters to you?"

Choice C: [Remain professional]
→ Agnieszka: "We're gathering information. That's all I can say right now."

[If Choice B selected:]
Magda: "My father lives there. He's old, and his health… it's been getting worse. He wrote to me last week. Said he went to see this man, and the cold doesn't feel as bad around him. That his joints don't ache as much."

[Otherwise, Magda continues:]

Magda: "My father lives there. He's old, and his health… it's been getting worse. He wrote to me last week. Said he went to see this man, and the cold doesn't feel as bad around him. That his joints don't ache as much."

Agnieszka: "How long has your father been feeling better?"

Magda: "A few days. But he says it's real. That he can feel it. The warmth, I mean. When the man is near."

Agnieszka keeps her tone gentle, but clear:

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 12

Choice A: [Offer realistic perspective]
→ Agnieszka: "People see what they want to see, especially in winters like this. Hope can make us feel better, even if nothing has actually changed. But I'll find out the truth. That's a promise."

Choice B: [Show understanding]
→ Agnieszka: "I understand how much you want this to be real. For your father's sake. I'm going to Zatonie today to investigate. I'll find out what's really happening."

Choice C: [Be cautious]
→ Agnieszka: "If it's real, the Church will verify it. But we need to be careful. False hope can be just as dangerous as no hope. I'll investigate thoroughly."

Magda doesn't argue. She just shivers and looks away, but there's gratitude in her expression.

Magda: "I just want my father to be okay. That's all."

Agnieszka: "I understand. And I'll find out the truth. That's a promise."

Magda offers a weak smile before hurrying away, disappearing into the snowfall.

🚗 SCENE 6: CHURCH PARKING LOT

[BACKGROUND: A small parking lot behind the church. The snow has been partially cleared, but patches of ice remain. An aging car sits in the lot, its windows fogged. The car is small, practical, clearly well-used but maintained. Through the windows, you can see items inside. The church looms in the background, its stone walls dark against the white sky. Snow continues to fall, though lighter here, protected somewhat by the building.]

[CHARACTER: Marek - A young man in his early twenties, tall and lanky. He has bright, eager eyes and a ready smile. His dark hair is slightly messy, as if he's been running his hands through it. He's wearing a simple black cassock, but it's clear he's still getting used to it—he adjusts it frequently. He stands beside the car, checking things, his movements energetic, almost nervous. When he sees Agnieszka, his whole face lights up with enthusiasm.]

Marek stands beside a small, aging car with defrost lines barely working. He's checking something under the hood when he sees Agnieszka approaching. He waves awkwardly, almost too enthusiastically.

Marek: "Sister Agnieszka! I've been waiting. I warmed the seats. Well, one of them. The other one didn't heat up. Sorry about that."

[CHARACTER: Agnieszka - Approaches the car, her expression calm but observant. She's taking in Marek's energy, his enthusiasm, assessing what it will be like to work with him.]

Agnieszka stands beside the car, looking at it. Inside the car, visible through the windows:
- a thermos labeled "Herbata"
- rosary beads hanging from the mirror
- a map folded messily
- a Bible with sticky notes sticking out
- an old dashboard radio crackling faintly

Everything is cluttered in a human way.

Marek opens the passenger door politely, almost too enthusiastically.

Marek: "Ready to go? I've checked the route. It should take about two hours, but with this weather, maybe longer."

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 13

Choice A: [Thank him for preparing]
→ Agnieszka: "Thank you for being so thorough, Brother Marek. I appreciate the preparation."

Choice B: [Ask about the car]
→ Agnieszka: "Is the car reliable? We don't want to get stuck in this weather."

Choice C: [Get straight to business]
→ Agnieszka: "Thank you, Brother Marek. Have you been to Zatonie before?"

[If Choice A selected:]
Marek: "Oh, it's nothing! I wanted to make sure everything was perfect. This is my first real assignment, you know."

[If Choice B selected:]
Marek: "I checked everything this morning. The engine's good, the tires are fine. We should be okay. But I packed extra blankets, just in case."

[If Choice C selected, or if other choices lead here:]

Agnieszka: "Thank you, Brother Marek. Have you been to Zatonie before?"

Marek: "No. I only know what everyone knows. People moved out years ago. Factories closed. A few families stayed… for reasons nobody really understands."

He moves to the driver's side, but pauses before getting in, his expression turning serious for a moment.

Marek: "But I'm excited! This is my first real assignment. Father Stanisław said you're the best person to learn from."

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 14

Choice A: [Be modest]
→ Agnieszka: "I'm not sure about that. But I'll do my best to help you understand what we're doing."

Choice B: [Set expectations]
→ Agnieszka: "I appreciate that, but remember—we're here to observe, not to jump to conclusions. That's the most important thing."

Choice C: [Ask about his preparation]
→ Agnieszka: "What have you read about this situation? How much do you know?"

[If Choice A selected:]
Marek: "I've been reading about saints. About how the Church verifies miracles. It's fascinating! The process is so careful, so methodical."

[If Choice B selected:]
Marek: "Right. Observe. I understand. But... what if we actually see something? A real miracle?"

[If Choice C selected:]
Marek: "I've read the testimonies Father Stanisław showed me. And I've been studying how the Church investigates these things. It's fascinating! The process is so careful, so methodical."

Agnieszka: "That's because we need to be careful. False miracles can do more harm than good."

Marek: "But what if this one is real? What if we're about to witness something incredible?"

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 15

Choice A: [Keep him grounded]
→ Agnieszka: "Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We're going to observe. To listen. To gather facts. That's all. No assumptions."

Choice B: [Acknowledge the possibility]
→ Agnieszka: "If it's real, we'll know. But we need proof, not stories. That's why we're going—to find the truth."

Choice C: [Warn about expectations]
→ Agnieszka: "Marek, I need you to keep your expectations in check. Most of these turn out to be nothing. We need to be prepared for that."

[All choices lead to Marek nodding, but his enthusiasm remains visible.]

Marek nods, but his enthusiasm doesn't dim.

Marek: "Right. Observe. Listen. Got it. But still... it's exciting, isn't it?"

[SCENE TRANSITION: They get into the car and drive]

🛣️ SCENE 7: DRIVING OUT OF THE CITY

[BACKGROUND: Car interior view, city streets passing by outside. The car is old but functional. The dashboard shows various dials and gauges. The windshield wipers work steadily, clearing snow. Outside, tall blocks of flats rise on both sides, their windows fogged from the cold inside. The city gradually gives way to more open spaces. The car heater struggles but provides some warmth. The radio plays softly in the background, mostly static with occasional clear moments.]

[CHARACTER: Agnieszka - Sitting in the passenger seat, but shown standing for dialogue (VN style). She looks out the window, her expression thoughtful. Her hands rest calmly in her lap, but there's a slight tension in her posture—she's alert, observant.]

[CHARACTER: Marek - Driving, but shown standing for dialogue (VN style). He's focused on the road, but also eager to talk. His movements are slightly animated even when standing, showing his energy.]

The car leaves the main streets. Tall blocks of flats rise on both sides, windows fogged from the cold inside. The car heater struggles.

Agnieszka looks at the frost creeping around the windshield edges, then turns to Marek.

Agnieszka: "Do you believe in miracles, Brother Marek?"

Marek's expression becomes thoughtful, serious for a moment.

Marek: "I believe they happen, yes. I've read the accounts. Lourdes, Fatima, all the verified cases. God works in mysterious ways."

Agnieszka: "But you also believe people exaggerate?"

Marek: "Of course. That's why we're going, right? To separate truth from exaggeration. To see what's really happening."

He smiles, trying to sound confident, but there's a hint of uncertainty.

Marek: "Just a man helping others. That's all I expect. But if there's more to it… well, that would be amazing, wouldn't it?"

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 16

Choice A: [Be practical]
→ Agnieszka: "Amazing, yes. But also complicated. If this man really is performing miracles, the Church will need to investigate thoroughly. It could take years."

Choice B: [Share her perspective]
→ Agnieszka: "I've learned to be cautious about these things. Hope is powerful, but it can also blind us. We need to see clearly."

Choice C: [Acknowledge the possibility]
→ Agnieszka: "If it's real, it would be remarkable. But we can't let that hope cloud our judgment. Facts first, always."

[If Choice A selected:]
Marek: "Years? But people need help now. If he can help them, shouldn't we let him?"

Agnieszka: "It's not that simple. We need to make sure it's real. That it's from God, not from… something else."

Marek: "Something else? Like what?"

Agnieszka: "Like wishful thinking. Like coincidence. Like people seeing what they want to see."

Marek: "But what if it's real?"

Agnieszka: "Then we'll know. But we need proof. Not just stories."

Nothing suspicious. Nothing supernatural. Just two people traveling, having a conversation about faith and doubt.

❄️ SCENE 8: MIDWAY THROUGH THE DRIVE — SUBTLE HOOK

[BACKGROUND: Car interior, heavy snow outside, visibility poor. The windshield wipers work frantically, but the snow is coming down so heavily that visibility is limited to just a few meters ahead. The landscape outside is a blur of white. The radio crackles with static, occasionally picking up signals. The car moves slowly, carefully.]

[CHARACTER: Agnieszka - Her expression is slightly more tense now. The weather is getting worse, and she's aware of it. She watches the road ahead, her hands slightly clenched.]

[CHARACTER: Marek - His expression shows concentration and slight concern. He's focused on driving, but also aware of the worsening conditions.]

Snow gets heavier. Visibility drops dramatically. The radio shifts frequencies on its own — but it's clearly because of bad reception. Marek reaches over to adjust it, his movements careful.

A weather alert comes through, the voice crackling and distorted:

Radio Voice: "—all travel to peripheral districts is discouraged due to road conditions— —Zatonie district remains without stable heating— —temperatures expected to drop to minus fifteen tonight— —repeat, all non-essential travel—"

Marek glances at Agnieszka, his expression worried.

Marek: "Minus fifteen. That's… that's really cold. And they're saying not to travel."

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 17

Choice A: [Reassure him]
→ Agnieszka: "It is. But we'll be fine. We have the car, and we won't be staying long. We'll be careful."

Choice B: [Acknowledge the concern]
→ Agnieszka: "I know. But we need to get there. We can't turn back now. Just drive carefully."

Choice C: [Check if he wants to continue]
→ Agnieszka: "Are you comfortable continuing? If you're not, we can turn back. Your safety matters."

[If Choice A or B selected:]
Marek: "Do you think he really keeps people warm somehow? The man, I mean. If the weather's this bad, maybe that's why people believe it?"

[If Choice C selected:]
Marek: "No, no. I'm fine. We should continue. I was just... thinking out loud. Do you think he really keeps people warm somehow?"

Agnieszka keeps her posture calm, but there's a slight tension in her voice.

Agnieszka: "Body heat, optimism, crowded rooms. When people gather together, they share warmth. It's natural. People invent saints when they're afraid."

Marek: "But the testimonies… they said the snow melts around him. That's not just body heat."

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 18

Choice A: [Maintain skepticism]
→ Agnieszka: "It could be exaggeration. Or it could be something else entirely. We won't know until we see it ourselves."

Choice B: [Show slight uncertainty]
→ Agnieszka: "I don't know, Marek. That's why we're going. To find out. But I'm trying not to assume anything."

Choice C: [Acknowledge the strangeness]
→ Agnieszka: "You're right. That is strange. But there could be a rational explanation. We need to see it with our own eyes."

Agnieszka looks out the window. The snow outside moves like a thick curtain, obscuring everything beyond a few meters.

Agnieszka (inner thought): "What are we really going to find? A fraud? A desperate man? Or something I can't explain?"

She shakes her head, dismissing the thought. She needs to stay focused. Stay grounded.

🏚️ SCENE 9: ARRIVING NEAR ZATONIE

[BACKGROUND: The landscape changes. The car is now driving through countryside, then smaller towns. The buildings here are older, more weathered. Many are abandoned—empty factories with broken windows, closed shops with faded signs, houses with boarded-up windows. The snow continues to fall, but it's lighter here. The road is narrower, less maintained. The sky is gray, heavy with clouds.]

[CHARACTER: Agnieszka - Her expression is observant, taking in the changing landscape. She's noting the decay, the emptiness, the sense of a place left behind.]

[CHARACTER: Marek - His expression shows surprise, maybe disappointment. This isn't what he expected.]

The landscape changes. The city gives way to countryside, then to smaller towns. The buildings here are older, more weathered. Many are abandoned—empty factories, closed shops, houses with boarded-up windows.

Marek: "It's… emptier than I expected."

Agnieszka: "People left when the factories closed. There wasn't much reason to stay."

Marek: "But some stayed. Why?"

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 19

Choice A: [Explain practically]
→ Agnieszka: "Family. Roots. The inability to leave. Or maybe they just didn't have anywhere else to go."

Choice B: [Show understanding]
→ Agnieszka: "Sometimes leaving is harder than staying. Even when staying means hardship. These are their homes."

Choice C: [Be analytical]
→ Agnieszka: "Economic factors, mostly. The elderly can't relocate easily. Families with deep roots. People who couldn't afford to leave even when they wanted to."

[SCENE TRANSITION: Town square of Zatonie]

[BACKGROUND: The town square of Zatonie. It's small, mostly empty. Old cobblestones are visible beneath the snow. A few benches, mostly unused. Old buildings surround the square, many with dark windows. A few have lights on, showing signs of life. The square itself is mostly empty, but there are footprints in the snow, showing people have been here recently. The snow continues to fall, but lighter now. The atmosphere is quiet, almost too quiet. There's a sense of watchfulness, as if the town itself is observing the newcomers.]

They arrive in the town square. The town is small, quiet. A few people are visible—mostly elderly, walking slowly through the snow. They look up as Agnieszka and Marek approach, their expressions unreadable.

[CHARACTER: Local Elderly Man - An old man in a heavy coat, walking slowly with a cane. He stops when he sees them, his expression guarded, watchful. He doesn't approach, but he doesn't look away either.]

Marek: "They're watching us."

Agnieszka: "Strangers are rare here. Of course they're watching."

Marek: "Do you think they know why we're here?"

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 20

Choice A: [Be direct]
→ Agnieszka: "Probably. Word travels fast in small towns. Especially when it involves someone they're calling a saint."

Choice B: [Show caution]
→ Agnieszka: "Maybe. Or maybe they're just curious about strangers. Either way, we should be careful what we say."

Choice C: [Observe first]
→ Agnieszka: "I don't know. But we should observe before we ask questions. See what we can learn just by watching."

The streets are narrow, the buildings close together. Most windows are dark, but a few have lights on.

Marek: "Where are we going first?"

Agnieszka: "To find him. The man. We need to see him, speak with him. That's where we start."

Marek: "And if he doesn't want to talk to us?"

🎮 SMALL CHOICE 21

Choice A: [Be determined]
→ Agnieszka: "Then we'll find another way. But let's start with the direct approach. Honesty is usually best."

Choice B: [Show flexibility]
→ Agnieszka: "We'll adapt. But first, let's try being direct. If that doesn't work, we'll find another way."

Choice C: [Be strategic]
→ Agnieszka: "We'll observe first. See where he is, what he's doing. Then we'll decide how to approach him."

They turn a corner, and the town square comes into full view. It's small, mostly empty. But there, in the center, stands a figure.

A man. Alone. Standing in the snow, seemingly unaffected by the cold.

[CHARACTER: The Man - A figure in the distance, standing in the center of the square. He's too far away to see clearly, but his posture is calm, still. He's not moving, just standing there, as if waiting. The snow falls around him, but there's something... different. The snow near him seems to be melting, creating a small circle of clear ground around his feet.]

Marek: "Is that…?"

Agnieszka: "I don't know. But we're about to find out."

They approach slowly, carefully. The man turns, and for a moment, his eyes meet Agnieszka's.

[CHARACTER: The Man - Now closer, his features become visible. He's in his thirties, with kind eyes and a gentle expression. He's wearing simple, warm clothing, but nothing extraordinary. His face is calm, peaceful. But there's something in his eyes—a depth, an intensity that's hard to place. And around his feet, the snow is definitely melting, creating a small circle of wet ground.]

Then he smiles. A warm, gentle smile.

And the snow around his feet begins to melt.

Text fades in: "The investigation begins. But some questions have answers that change everything."
